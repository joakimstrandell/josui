# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in [our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to create a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository and follow the prompts to describe your changes.

## How to release

1. Run `pnpm version-packages` to bump versions based on changesets
2. Review the changes and commit
3. Run `pnpm release` to publish to npm
